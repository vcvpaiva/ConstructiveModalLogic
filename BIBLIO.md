fragment with transitive relations, in: Proc. 14th IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer Science, IEEE
Computer Society Press, 1999, pp. 24–34] on decidability of the two variable monadic guarded fragment
of first order logic with constraints on the guard relations expressible in monadic second order logic.
In [H. Ganzinger, C. Meyer, M. Veanes, The two-variable guarded fragment with transitive relations,
in: Proc. 14th IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer Science, IEEE Computer Society Press, 1999, pp. 24–34],
such constraints apply to one relation at a time. We modify their proof to obtain decidability for
constraints involving several relations. Now we can use this result to prove decidability of multi-modal
modal logics where conditions on accessibility relations involve more than one relation.
Our main application is intuitionistic modal logic, where the intuitionistic and modal accessibility
relations usually interact in a non-trivial way.}
