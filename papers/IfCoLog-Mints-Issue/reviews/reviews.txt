Dear Valeria

Here are two favourable reports on your  submission to the Mints memorial issue of the  IfCoLog Journal of Logics and their Applications.

Following the recommendation of both referees, the editors would like to accept your paper for publication, subject to the revisions being made that are suggested in the reports.

Please will you return the paper to me (I will need source files and pdf, please) and let me know in a covering note that you've dealt with all the issues raised by both referees.

Thank you,
Jane



======== referee 1 ==========
The contribution in this paper is sound and original. The study of tense
intuitionistic logic, tense logic in general, and the categorical model have
been proven of importance. The authors convinced me that they did what
was promised in the first section. Technical comments on the paper can be
found in the added pdf file.
I recommend the publication of the paper.
